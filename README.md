# Teacher Wish List

## Welcome to my Rails App!

This basic app was modeled after the website DonorsChoose.org. The purpose of this app is to allow a user to login through deciding how they want to interact with it. Selecting if they a teacher or a donor. 

Once a teacher logins, it allows them to create new schools, add items they need and perform the basic CRUD functionalities on those items. 

A donor is able to choose how much money they want to donate then browse the needed items. If they have enough money, they are able to donate the item for that teacher. 

## Install Instructions

To begin using this app, clone the repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, and then run `shotgun`.
